## Description ##

**This is a feature plugin proposed for WordPress 4.4**

The WordPress Customizer is a framework for previewing any change to a site.
By default, settings exposed in the Customizer use a `refresh` transport,
meaning that in order for a setting change to be applied, the entire preview
has to reload, which has a huge performance hit. The result is a preview that
is anything but live. To remedy this poor user experience of a laggy
preview, the Customizer allows settings to opt-in to using a `postMessage`
transport. This relies on JavaScript to apply the changes live without doing
any server-side communication at all: changes are applied instantly.

There is a major issue with settings using the `postMessage` transport,
however: any logic used in PHP to render the setting in the template has to be
duplicated in JavaScript. Thus the transport is not DRY, and so it is really only
suitable for simple text or style changes that involve almost no logic, and this
is commonplace in themes.

What the Customizer needs is a middle-ground between refreshing the entire preview
to apply changes with PHP and applying the changes exclusively with JavaScript.
The partial preview refresh is one solution, and is proposed in [#27355](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27355).

Partial preview refreshing was first explored when Customizer widget management
was being developed for the 3.9 release. It was [added](https://github.com/xwp/wp-widget-customizer/pull/37)
to the Widget Customizer plugin, and described in a [Make Core post](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/28/widget-customizer-feature-as-plugin-merge-proposal/#section-live-previews).
But [we decided](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112#comment:10) to
[remove](https://github.com/xwp/wp-widget-customizer/compare/without-partial-previews)
the feature in favor of having a better generalized framework for partial refreshes
in a future release. Partial preview refreshing has been added in 4.3 for changes
to menus which can now be managed in the Customizer.

This plugin first focuses on resurrecting partial preview refreshes for widgets.
We can then explore adding partial refresh support to other object types, such
as ~~menus,~~ inline styles, and especially to provide an API for developers to
register arbitrary regions as being partial-refreshable, in part by associating
a CSS selector with a given Customizer setting.

<em>Blue sky:</em> If we can eliminate full-page refreshes, we can start to
introduce controls inline with the preview (e.g. widget controls appearing
with their widgets), and even eliminate the Customizer <code>iframe</code>
altogether since the Customizer pane could then slide-in on any existing
frontend page the user is on without having enter into a completely different
Customizer state; when done, they can just collapse the Customizer away and
continue on their way browsing the site.
### Usage ###
To opt-in to partial preview refreshes for a theme, add:

```php
add_theme_support( 'customize-partial-refresh-widgets' );
```

When this is done, widgets in Core will automatically use partial refreshes.
To opt-in to partial refreshes for other widget types, use this to opt-in for
a specific widget:

```php
add_filter( "customize_widget_partial_refreshable_{$id_base}", '__return_true' );
```

And use this to opt-in everything:

```php
add_filter( 'customize_widget_partial_refreshable', '__return_true' );
```
